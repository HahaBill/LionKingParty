The Lion King Party
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mufasa is the main ruler of the Lion King kingdom, and he wants to celebrate the expansion of 
the kingdom with an animal party. Not just any animal party, though; the best animal party possible, as befits a kingdom called the Lion King.

To that end, heâ€™s come up with a party-animal score for every animal in the Lion King kingdom. The party-animal score is a number, 
and the higher the party-animal score, the more fun that the animal will contribute to a party. Party-animal scores may be positive, negative, or zero.
However, Mufasa knows that who you party with is important. If an animal's ruler is at a party,
then the animal will spend all their time looking over their shoulder for their ruler, and that's not fun. Therefore, at this animal party, no animal and their ruler will
both be invited. 

GOALS : 
Your task, as a party organizer, is to write a program that takes in 
an animal listing and outputs the guests to invite in order to maximize the sum of the guests' party-animal scores.

RULES : 
1. A ruler's ruler is okay, but you can't have both an animal and their ruler.
2. No animals will have the same name, so there is no need to worry about name collisions.
3. Each animal has exactly one ruler and appears in the input exactly one time except for the main ruler, who has no ruler.
4. The Lion King kingdom is going to sell your code as a service to other animal kingdoms, so do not assume that the main ruler is always named Mufasa.
5. For bonus points: ensure that your solution always invites the main ruler.
